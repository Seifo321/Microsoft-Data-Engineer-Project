## **Project Overview**
This project aims to build an end-to-end data engineering pipeline designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data into a central data warehouse for analysis and insights. The project integrates with cloud-based solutions such as **Azure Data Factory** for orchestrating pipelines, **Azure Synapse Analytics** for data storage and querying, and **Power BI** for visualization.

Additionally, machine learning models are incorporated to provide **predictive analytics** and **forecasting** for improved decision-making.

---

## **Architecture**
The architecture consists of several integrated Azure services for an efficient, scalable, and secure data pipeline.


- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Manages ETL pipelines.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Acts as a data warehouse for storage and large-scale querying.
- **Databricks**: Enables advanced data transformation and machine learning.
- **Power BI**: Generates visual insights and dashboards.
- **Azure Machine Learning**: Supports machine learning model development and deployment.

---

## **Technologies**
This project uses the following tools and platforms:
- **SQL Server** or **Relational Databases**: Stores transactional data.
- **Azure Data Factory**: Orchestrates ETL operations.
- **Azure Databricks**: Handles large-scale data transformation and machine learning.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Centralized data warehouse.
- **Power BI**: Visualization platform.
- **Azure Machine Learning**: For building and deploying predictive models.
- **Python**: Used for scripting transformations and machine learning.

---

## **Project Objectives**
1. **Data Extraction**: Pull data from structured or semi-structured sources.
2. **Data Transformation**: Clean, aggregate, and normalize data.
3. **Data Loading**: Store the processed data in a centralized data warehouse.
4. **Data Visualization**: Create dashboards for reporting and analytics.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Leverage machine learning to forecast trends and provide insights.

---

## **Data Flow**
1. **Source (SQL, CSV, etc.)**: Data is pulled from different data sources.
2. **ETL in Azure Data Factory**: ADF orchestrates the data extraction and transformation.
3. **Data Transformation (Databricks)**: Data is processed, cleaned, and prepared for analytics.
4. **Azure Synapse Analytics**: The transformed data is loaded into Synapse for further analysis.
5. **Power BI Dashboards**: Connect to Synapse to visualize trends and insights.
6. **Machine Learning Models**: Predictive models are developed to forecast trends.

## **Setup and Configuration**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Azure Subscription**: Access to Azure services like Data Factory, Synapse, Databricks, and Power BI.
- **Database**: A SQL Server instance or any other source where data is stored.
- **Power BI Desktop**: For designing data visualizations.

### **Azure Resource Setup**
1. **Create SQL Database**: Import your dataset into a SQL Server.
2. **Create Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Set up data pipelines to extract and transform data.
3. **Create Azure Synapse Analytics**: Use Synapse for data storage and querying.
4. **Create Azure Databricks**: Perform large-scale data processing and machine learning tasks.
5. **Power BI**: Design dashboards to visualize insights from the data.

## **Pipeline Stages**

### **1. Data Extraction (Azure Data Factory)**
- Use **ADF** to orchestrate the data extraction from various sources (SQL, CSV, API).

### **2. Data Transformation (Databricks)**
- Perform **complex transformations** using **Databricks** and **Apache Spark** for distributed data processing.

### **3. Data Loading (Azure Synapse Analytics)**
- Load the cleaned and transformed data into **Azure Synapse Analytics** for storage and analysis.

### **4. Machine Learning (Databricks)**
- Build and train machine learning models using **Databricks** and track experiments with **MLflow**.

### **5. Data Visualization (Power BI)**
- Create interactive dashboards to visualize KPIs, trends, and predictive insights.
