## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on building an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for the **BikeStores** retail dataset. It extracts data from an SQL database using **Azure Data Factory**, transforms and loads it into **Azure Synapse Analytics** for analysis, and finally generates insights and forecasts through **Power BI** visualizations and predictive **machine learning models**.

The goal is to provide a high-performance, automated pipeline for effective data management and analysis, incorporating best practices for ETL processes, scalable infrastructure, and forecasting insights to support business decision-making.

---

## **Architecture**
The architecture consists of several integrated Azure services to ensure an efficient, scalable, and secure data pipeline.

## **Data Flow**
1. **Source (SQL Database)**: Contains raw transactional data for BikeStores.
2. **ETL in ADF**: Data is extracted, cleaned, and transformed.
3. **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Transformed data is loaded for storage and analysis.
4. **Power BI**: Generates interactive reports and insights based on data.
5. **Machine Learning Models**: Forecasting models are deployed to predict future sales trends.

## **Setup and Configuration**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have access to Azure services like Data Factory, Synapse, Power BI, and Machine Learning.
- **SQL Server**: The BikeStores database should be hosted in a SQL Server.
- **Power BI Desktop**: Install Power BI Desktop for designing reports.

### **Azure Resource Setup**
1. **Create SQL Database**: Import the BikeStores dataset into a SQL Server database.
2. **Create Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Set up ADF for managing your ETL process.
3. **Create Azure Synapse Analytics**: Deploy an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace to store and query your data.
4. **Power BI Dashboard**: Connect Power BI to Synapse to visualize data insights.

## **Pipeline Stages**

### **1. Data Extraction (Azure Data Factory)**
- Use **Copy Data Activity** in ADF to extract data from the SQL database.

### **2. Data Transformation (Databricks)**
- Use **Databricks** for complex data transformation using **Apache Spark**.
- Perform distributed data processing, cleaning, and feature engineering.

### **3. Data Loading (Azure Synapse Analytics)**
- Load the cleaned and transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics.

### **4. Machine Learning (Databricks)**
- Build and train machine learning models using **Spark MLlib** and **MLflow**.
- Use **Databricks Delta Lake** for efficient data management and versioning.

### **5. Visualization (Power BI)**
- Connect Power BI to Synapse to visualize insights and predictive analytics.
